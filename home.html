    <h5> Six months ago, the company founders detected a decline in productivity. They
quickly linked it to a lack of employee motivation and engagement. We have since
taken action and set up a steering committee on well-being at work two months ago.
It is made up of a dozen people, including management representatives and
employees. Its role is to send out surveys to employees and share the results with the
Human Resources department to consider further action which could improve
employeesâ€™ well-being.
The most recent survey confirmed that some members of staff were not satisfied with
the atmosphere at work. The following data was particularly eye-opening.<br>Here there is an oppurtunity to improve our company ,sharing your though by post.</h5>
